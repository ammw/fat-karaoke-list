# Fat Karaoke List
A local cache for FAAK's karaoke songlist.

## What's this?
The songlist is getting longer and longer. That's not bad, but it's already too big to open it on my phone, especially when we're in a basement and the reception is bad.

This Android (Nougat 7.1.1+) application is supposed to download the list and search the local copy.

## Project status
It's still work-in-progress, so may not be perfect (yet).

Also, I haven't done any Android development for ages - feel free to report any issues, I'll try my best to fix them up!
